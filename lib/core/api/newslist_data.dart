        """ Two robots from Singapore will begin securing the perimeter of SAMMinistries downtown shelter starting next week.
Since the nonprofit, which offers housing and services for people experiencing homelessness, opened the shelter at a downtown San Antonio Holiday Inn in December 2023, it has contracted with Texas Veteran Security to patrol the site.

Across three shifts, 27 guards monitor the perimeter of the former hotel, at 318 W. Cesár E. Chávez Blvd. on the west side of downtown, by foot and vehicle around the clock.
SAMMinistries needed more security guards because its capacity for unsheltered people has grown. 'We went from a 52-room facility to a 200-room facility. Multiply everything by four, that includes security costs,' said Rex Brien, vice president of Emergency Services for SAMMinistries.  

But now, the two new security robots will save costs, shelter and security officials say, by patrolling the outdoor perimeter 24/7. No guards are being laid off, Texas Veteran Security\’s CEO Gerard Morales said, adding that the 70% of employees are veterans. Instead, the robots will enhance staff capabilities, by not adding more staff, he said.
'[Guards are] going to be used inside to beef up security, instead of outside watch guards' Morales said. 'Instead of adding people, we\’ll be able to view [surveillance] from the guard\’s post at the front.'
'Deterrent is what we want from these robots,' he said.

SAMMinistries said the shelter needs the robots because of its location in a heavy foot traffic area. And with some approvals delaying construction on the exterior fence, according to the nonprofit, security needs to guard the perimeter to keep strangers from entering.
The 'O-R3' robots, made by Singapore-based robotics maker OTSAW, are autonomous, outdoor surveillance robots that memorize their path, and therefore don\’t need to be controlled remotely.

They can patrol open spaces, avoid obstacles through their sensors, and return to their bases when their charge runs out. 
The robots record video and photos of a 360-degree view while they patrol the outdoor perimeter. Officers don\’t have to monitor the cameras, instead they\’re alerted when an obstacle arises, when a person is identified or if someone asks for help. The robots can stop and let a person walk or a car pass, and can go around objects in the way.

'We\’re looking at ways to reduce costs but still keeping safety in mind. We don\’t want to compromise safety for our residents [or] our staff,' Brien said.""",

        'QR codes at San Antonio bus stops change the game for visually impaired commuters',

    'description':
        """ Just about all VIA Metropolitan Transit bus stops across San Antonio are getting small, colorful QR codes, part of a system for blind, low-vision and non-English speaking locals and visitors to better navigate the city.
The NaviLens system is already installed at 100 of San Antonio\’s most-used bus stops, and it will be completely installed at more than 6,000 of them within the next year.
The expanding wayfinding system uses an app, where it automatically detects QR codes from up to 50 feet away and gives real-time bus route information for the user in 34 languages.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York\’s metro, already uses the same QR technology, and other companies like Coca-Cola and Kellogg\’s are adding it to their packaging.

VIA first tested the system through a pilot program in 2021, adding 100 NaviLens QR codes at San Antonio\’s most-used bus stops. It leads the user to the bus stop, reads the QR code in any light condition, without focusing the mobile camera, and works even when a user is unaware they are near a code.
U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, secured congressional funding for the technology in 2022. VIA trustees approved the plan to expand the program in January 2023.
Having better resources for visually impaired commuters was VIA Trustee Athalie Malone\’s goal when she took her seat in 2019. Malone, who is visually impaired, discovered NaviLens while helping to plan a trip to Europe.

“I\’ve only been blind 17 years,” Malone said. “When I lost my vision, I was still using the bus. … Where it got harder was to know which bus was coming.”
The audible voice on the bus announcing each stop helped, but the app also helps guide her to the correct stop, she said.

Vibrant Works, formerly named San Antonio Lighthouse for the Blind, partnered with VIA for the pilot program. Ernest Arce, who works at the nonprofit that provides jobs for visually impaired people as a sewing machine operator and uses VIA to get to work, was delighted to learn the system would be expanded to nearly all bus stops. 
“That\’s wonderful news,” he said Monday, standing outside the bus stop near his job. He hadn\’t heard the system was being expanded, but was familiar with it because he\’s a daily user at stops that already have NaviLens, including the one at his workplace.
Arce, a native San Antonian who has been blind since birth, was one of the first people to test the program when it rolled out in 2021. He said there wasn\’t anything about the system he didn\’t like — except that it wasn\’t at each stop. 
The system gives users real-time bus information, a benefit the previously sought Braille system of signs at the stops wasn\’t able to offer. 
“If it was in more areas, other blind people would have more use for it,” Arce said.

The system will help non-English speakers too, according to VIA, by giving real-time information in 34 languages so far.
Nadia Mavrakis, CEO of local nonprofit Culturingua, which helps Middle Eastern, South Asian and North African immigrants settle into life in San Antonio, said VIA sought feedback from the immigrant-serving community that has been taken into account. The next step could be adding Pashto.
Pashto is a tier-two language on the City of San Antonio\’s language access plan, meaning translation is recommended and interpretation is available upon request for city services.
'Having Pashto would be an important addition to ensure the majority of the Afghan community is able to access VIA services,' she said.

VIA spokeswoman Lorraine Pulido said VIA will work to include all languages San Antonio needs in the NaviLens system.""",

        'Students scramble as Codeup closure leaves them in debt, unsure how to complete their studies',

    'description':
        """  Nani Rios has a full-stack web development certificate of completion from Codeup and a \$28,000 loan at 10% interest.What she doesn\’t have is access to the school\’s placement program, nor its guaranteed tuition refund if she doesn\’t find a job. Rios, 23, took out the loan to attend the for-profit bootcamp because she believed it was a low-risk proposition.

“They promised to help me find a job or I\’d get my money back,” said Rios, who heard about Codeup from her husband, who is in the military. She knew that veterans could use their VA benefits for tuition, and that, too, made her feel comfortable. “The military trusted it.”Her cohort was just a week and a half from completing its coursework when Codeup stunned students and remaining staff by closing abruptly on Dec. 28. That day, school officials sent an email that announced the school\’s immediate closure, reversing course from a Dec. 8 communication that said Codeup was committed to allowing current students to complete their programs.
Rios, whose only previous work experience was in retail, was counting on Codeup\’s placement services to help her find a web developer job. She said she\’s been working on her résumé and updating her LinkedIn profile, “but I\’m not receiving any of the guidance I was promised after graduation. I\’m left with so much debt.”
Rios wasn\’t the only student who considered Codeup\’s placement services part of what she was paying for. A student who graduated with a data sciences certificate in November said he was swayed by the school\’s emphasis on the relationships it had built with local companies to help Codeup students get hired.

“There\’s tons of other boot camps, and this information is even available free in a lot of places,” said Brock Green, who financed roughly half of the \$31,000 tuition and completed the program a month before Codeup closed. “For me, the value was not in the classroom, it was in this idea that the school had connections.” Codeup, he said, “has not filled their end of the bargain.”

It\’s unclear how many students were enrolled at the time of closure. Emails to students show several cohorts, which generally included anywhere from six to 15 students.While some students took out loans to finance the courses, the vast majority of students at Codeup over the past several years were military veterans. Crystal Poenisch, a former Codeup student who later worked in the marketing department, said “veterans with VA benefits” were “our No. 1 target.”

‘Stuck and scrambling\’
Poli Gonzalez is one of those veterans, and while he\’s not facing debt like some non-veteran students, he was using a program for disabled vets that also included a housing allowance. That has now evaporated.
Gonzalez moved to San Antonio to attend the school, signed an eight-month lease, and started right about the time Codeup moved into new offices and quietly laid off roughly a quarter of its staff.

Gonzalez said he didn\’t know anything was amiss until then-CEO and co-founder Jason Straughan emailed students on Dec. 8 to say Codeup would no longer accept new students but remained “committed to delivering a quality education to each of you.”
Three weeks later, he got the email notifying him of the school\’s immediate closure. He immediately reached out to his counselor at the VA, who let him know his housing benefits would cease.

“They told me, ‘What you got last is what you got. There\’s not going to be any more,'” said Gonzalez, who is trying to figure out how he\’ll pay his rent and what to do next regarding his coursework. He said he plans on writing a letter to Congress to let them know that veterans like him are “stuck and scrambling.”""",

    'description':
        """ When the pandemic hit, Daniela Crispin was 14 years old and entering her first year of high school at the STEM Academy at LEE High School. She had always had a knack for technology and remembers being excited to start at the North East Independent School District magnet school that year.
But Crispin was forced to start her new journey from behind a computer screen in her small bedroom rather than in a classroom full of her peers. A lack of reliable internet didn\’t help matters.
“It was scary because immediately everything was shut down, and I didn\’t have a laptop,” she recalls. “We didn\’t have good internet, so we immediately had to switch to a better internet provider. The school was able to provide us with laptops, but they didn\’t really work — we had to work our way around with these laptops.”
Crispin\\’s father supports their family of four on a construction worker\’s wages, she said. Their monthly internet bill went from \$50 to \$80 a month, she said. When her borrowed laptop wasn\’t working well, she would try to do her homework on her smartphone — but it was difficult, she said.

“A lot of it was writing essays, and it was like texting but it was a lot of having to swipe out and go to Safari or Google to look up articles and read textbooks — I was just going back and forward and especially on such a small screen, it was hard,” Crispin said. “I started failing, because I need to be in a classroom focused on the teacher and being on the screen didn\’t help me.”
With the help of her school, family and local nonprofit Family Service, Crispin got her own laptop, which allowed her to finish high school with an associate degree.
Now she\’s enrolled at Texas A&M University-San Antonio, studying criminal justice, and on her way to becoming the first person in her family to graduate from college with a four-year degree.
But her story illustrates the obstacles facing San Antonians on the wrong side of the digital divide — the term coined for the disparity between those with access to the internet and those without it.

Affordability and digital literacy are still proving to be significant barriers to internet access for low-income families, residents of multifamily housing and elderly people in San Antonio. However, efforts across the region are picking up steam, fueled by incoming federal dollars and nonprofit initiatives. Both the county and city, as well as local nonprofits, have also launched programs within the last few years to try to better tackle the divide. Just in the past year, the city has dedicated \$8.9 million to the issue, the county an additional \$5.4 million, and nonprofits such as Methodist Healthcare Ministries have earmarked another \$21 million to closing the divide.
The city\’s latest digital inclusion survey, published in October, showed broadband access across San Antonio has risen from 80% in 2019 to 82% in 2023. 
However, barriers such as lack of infrastructure, affordability and understanding how to safely use the internet remain, said Rhia Pape, executive director of SA Digital Connects, a public-private organization working to expand digital access. Local digital advocates are hopeful that state and federal funds will help speed up the digital adoption process, especially among multifamily housing residents and residents living in the more rural and lower-income areas of the region.
“There\’s going to be a significant amount of progress over the next two years in the access and infrastructure [areas],” she said.

Reaching unincorporated areas
County efforts for more digital inclusion have been underway since late last year, but have picked up momentum within the last several months.
Bexar County allotted roughly \$25 million in federal pandemic relief money to digital inclusion efforts in August 2022.
The Bexar County Commissioners Court is set to vote next month on amending an existing contract with internet provider Spectrum that would expand the number of residents it is working on extending affordable internet access to over the next three years.

After approving a landmark agreement with Spectrum this past fall to help rural Bexar County residents gain better access to high-speed internet, the commissioners approved expanding that effort and will officially vote on approving an updated contract in late January.
Under the agreement with Spectrum, the county will give roughly \$5.4 million of its ARPA funds to Spectrum for the internet provider to build out high-speed broadband infrastructure to reach approximately 8,700 households, making it accessible to all of the county\’s unincorporated areas. As a part of that partnership, telecommunications company Spectrum has agreed to spend \$26.3 million to lay the roughly 600 miles of broadband cables across the county\’s east, south, and west sides by the end of 2025. Customers who want to connect to that internet will be able to at rates starting as low as \$30 a month.
Under the amended contract, an additional 1,800 homes will be able to have affordable access to service through another \$6.35 million pledged from the county and \$4.9 million from Spectrum.

    'description':
        """ His father was a judge, his uncle was a civil rights activist, and another uncle became the first Hispanic commissioner appointed by a president.
Sam Ximenes is a pioneering space architect who has a big vision and plans to make San Antonio a hub for space exploration and architecture.

Space architecture is the design and building of physical structures for human needs in outer space. As the field grows, more people are needed to build space stations, habitats and lunar or planetary bases.
And while his local companies achieve success through design, Ximenes is recruiting San Antonio students for the workforce, making STEM education, tech and architecture accessible.
His work, belief in education, and entrepreneurial spirit follow the steps of his family, who achieved the Mexican American dream through the same values.
Born at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston and baptized at the San Fernando Cathedral, the San Antonio native founded the Exploration Architecture Corporation, known as XArc, and Astroport Space Technologies, companies focused on designing and developing lunar surface infrastructure from raw moon material.
This year, their work attracted more than \$1 million in NASA grants to fund technologies needed for lunar surface landing and launch pads. 

In 2016, he founded the nonprofit WEX Foundation, which offers programs for children in San Antonio that introduce them to space exploration and engineering. It\’s named after his late father, Judge Waldo E. Ximenes, who he described as an unwavering proponent of educational opportunity for those who were economically or socially disadvantaged.
Ximenes has worked for aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin, L-3 Communications, and Futron Corporation, but he eventually came back to his roots in San Antonio. In May 2023, Ximenes was inducted into the San Antonio Aviation and Aerospace Hall of Fame. 

He comes from a line of exemplary Mexican American public servants: His uncle Vicente T. Ximenes was the first Hispanic commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
Another uncle, Edward Ximenes, was the first Hispanic member appointed to the Board of Regents for the University of Texas System. For 25 years, he advocated for a UT campus at San Antonio. Today, a UTSA campus driveway street and a building are named after him.

His family had roots in Floresville, but Ximenes grew up as a military brat, moving often. At seven years old, he lived in Germany at the height of the Cold War.
In a 2013 TedxSan Antonio Talk, Ximenes said he found a cave one day. He lay on his belly and crawled to the end of the tunnel in pure darkness and found a box of German coins. 

“That sense of adventure and discovery into the darkness of that cave has never left me,” he said in his speech. 
Today, Ximenes\’ companies are developing technology to explore caves on the lunar surface.
But where does that tech come from to get to the moon — or Mars?
“Right here,” he said. “You can\’t tell me the economic development of this lunar base is not tied to the economic development of the community that sponsored it: San Antonio.”

Because of the growth of his companies that work with space companies and agencies, like Virgin Galactic, the U.S. military and NASA, Ximenes spends most of his days doing administrative work. 
Much of what he talked about in that Tedx talk a decade ago has come to fruition, thanks to NASA depending on private companies and other institutions like the Southwest Research Institute and the University of Texas at San Antonio to advance space exploration.

Now, Ximenes is predicting a continuation of those partnerships. “What\’s going to happen next is we\’re going to build an economy,” he said. “The next economy is going to be in space: A cislunar economy,” referring to the space between the earth and the moon. 
And as people and starships begin to come and go while they dig for resources on the moon or Mars, Ximenes said fuel depots for them will be essential.
Grinning while he speaks, Ximenes has the enthusiastic energy of a visionary, but has the business plans to back it up.

Astroport\’s goal is to create the technology and architecture to be a space port fixed base operator, similar to business models that serve aircrafts, for example, doing refueling and maintenance. 
“We want to be the same thing on the moon for the rockets [and] lunar landers coming and going, to resupply,” he said. “It\’s the same model that provided the shuttles for the gold miners in the old days. We\’re not digging for gold, we\’re providing the shovels, is kind of my idea. … We\’re going to be the port, the gateway to the lunar locations.”
But that sort of work can\’t be done in the future without access to STEM education for young people to learn the necessary skills to succeed in the future. That\’s where his WEX Foundation comes in. 
On Dec. 4, Melody Herrera walked inside the Boeing Center at Tech Port with her 8-year-old nephew for an Aerospace workshop inside of Area 21, an introduction of what the WEX Foundation\’s space exploration LCATS program. 

“Recently we\’ve had school closures that are happening and I wanted to make sure they were aware of that because our students need resources,” Herrera said, explaining she had proactively reached out to Area 21 about opportunities for her nephew. 
“I hope it just gives him a learning opportunity to let him know his options and also just to help him with other executive function skills and knowledge that he\’s not getting in school,” she said. 
Out of all his ventures, the WEX Foundation is Ximenes\’ favorite endeavor. He chuckled describing the excitement on students\’ faces when they explore the lunar cave sites through the program. 
“We have students that have gone on to MIT. … Seeing that happen is very satisfying, seeing they\’re being successful,” he said. “We have students that have gone on to become NASA interns as well. … It\’s still a young program, but we\’re seeing the success.”""",
